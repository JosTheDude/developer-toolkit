This modpack is primarily built for **plugin** and **server** developers in mind. It contains a large variety of server-development utilities that are combined to become a cause the following reactions:
- "Oh, was that not just vanilla? My modpack does that for me!"
- "This is so annoyi- oh wait my modpack has a tool for that!"
- "I literally cannot live without this"
- Among other experiences, depending on use-case and usage.

Built to work **out of the box** with most settings pre-configured. Feel free to modify as needed. See the mod list for full list of functionality, alongside feature list below.
